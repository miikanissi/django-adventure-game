# :snake: Django Adventure Game 
Text based adventure game made using Django &amp; MySQL/SQlite.

Live demo of the app can be viewed at [my website](https://django.miikanissi.com).

This was a fun project during my Web Development course at HAMK UAS. This project helped me learn the basics of Django Framework and later I have used Django to build a couple other websites.

## How the game works
Playing the game is simple. You will face multiple choices to each scene and you select what you would do in the situation. The goal of the game is to survive. 

Under the hood the heavy lifting is done by Django's database queries. Each scene has options linked to it and those options have a link to another scene to proceed in the game. 
For each scene the background image can also be changed from the database.
